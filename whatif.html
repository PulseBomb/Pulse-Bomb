  <p>Genshin Impact has become one of the most iconic open-world RPGs of the modern era. But have you ever wondered what the gaming world would look like if it never existed?</p>

  <p>Without <strong>Genshin Impact</strong>, there would be no Teyvat to explore, no Paimon guiding (or annoying) us, and no endless grind for primogems. The massive community that grew around characters like Raiden Shogun, Zhongli, and Hu Tao wouldn’t exist, and countless friendships (and memes) might have never happened.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#66ccff;">What if?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What if Paimon never became the “Emergency Food” mascot?</li>
    <li>What if Teyvat remained just a dream in a developer’s notebook?</li>
    <li>What if players never had the thrill of pulling five-star characters?</li>
    <li>What if Resin burnout was never a thing?</li>
    <li>What if TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube weren’t flooded with Genshin content?</li>
    <li>What if the gacha model didn’t gain so much attention globally?</li>
    <li>What if millions of gamers never felt the pain of losing a 50/50?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sure, without Genshin, we might’ve saved money... maybe even had a healthier sleep schedule. But the world of gaming would’ve missed out on a beautiful blend of storytelling, music, design, and community connection.</p>

  <p>A world without Genshin Impact might be quieter, simpler — but it would also be far less magical.</p>

  <h3>What if Eren Didn’t Kill 80% of Humanity?</h3>
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/k52SD39L/2fab1ab052ce529e1d87bf3298284488.jpg" alt="Eren Alternate Timeline" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; border-radius:8px; margin-top:10px;" />
  <p>Imagine a world where Eren Yeager chose a different path—one without the Rumbling. Instead of wiping out 80% of humanity, what if he had found another way to secure freedom for Paradis Island?</p>

  <h4>1. No Global Genocide</h4>
  <p>The biggest consequence: millions of lives would be spared. The world wouldn't see Eren as a mass murderer, and Paradis might have had a chance at diplomacy.</p>

  <h4>2. The Alliance Might Not Exist</h4>
  <p>If Eren didn’t go extreme, Armin, Mikasa, and the others might not have needed to fight him. The team could have stayed united until the end.</p>

  <h4>3. Paradise’s Fate</h4>
  <p>Without the Rumbling, Paradis might still be targeted by the world powers. But maybe, just maybe, there was another way—through peace or strategic negotiation.</p>

  <h4>4. Eren's Legacy</h4>
  <p>Eren wouldn't be remembered as a villain or a hero who sacrificed everything. His legacy would’ve been complex, but perhaps less tragic.</p>
