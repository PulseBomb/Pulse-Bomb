  <p>After years of ninja missions and saving the world, Naruto Uzumaki has discovered his true calling — cooking ramen. The Seventh Hokage officially launched his new YouTube channel, <strong>“Ramen no Jutsu”</strong>.</p>
  <p>“Fighting was cool, but nothing beats a hot bowl of miso ramen,” Naruto told viewers in his first video, where he attempted to recreate the legendary Ichiraku recipe.</p>
  <p>Sasuke reportedly unsubscribed immediately, calling it a “betrayal of the ninja way.” Meanwhile, fans are going wild over his shadow clone technique to summon instant noodles.</p>
